# Python_Recursion
A repository of all the recursive implementations I've coded as part of my COSC262 course at UC.

Contains:
- HeffalumpHerbert, a recursive implementation of the classic Herbert the Heffalump problem
- Fibonacci(log n), a recursive implementation that computes any fibonacci number in )(log n) time using matrix multiplication
